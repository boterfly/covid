                        <h2>Why did we write this booklet?</h2>
                        <p>Difficult times demand a lot from us as individuals, 
                        and especially now as healthcare professionals. 
                        To help us care for ourselves as professionals in the care sector, 
                        it is important that we have clear, practical tips on how to deal with 
                        some of the difficult things that confront us during these exceptional times. 
                        This means ensuring that you, as professionals, can deal with the physical, 
                        emotional and psychological challenges that await you every day. Thatâ€™s why we wrote this booklet.</p>
